# Stock Trader

This is my third Vue.js 2 project.  

In this project, I made use of:

- `vuetify` (UI)
- `animate.css` (UI)
- `vue-router` (routes)
- `vuex` (state)
- `axios` (http)
- `Firebase` (database)

PS: This app is for study purposes focusing on Vue.js, so it doesn't have all the required resources for real-life use.
